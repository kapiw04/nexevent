### **1. Django Apps:**

Breaking the project into modular Django apps will help in easier management and scalability. Here's a suggested structure:

1. **Users**:
   - Custom user profiles.
   - User registration, login, and logout.
   - User profile settings (e.g., profile picture, bio).
2. **Events**:
   - Event creation, update, and deletion.
   - Event categories/tags.
   - Event location (potentially integrating with a map service).
   - Start and end dates/times.
   - Option for recurring events.
   - Event images/gallery.
   - User RSVP for events.
3. **Reviews**:
   - Allow attendees to write reviews for events.
   - Star-based rating system.
4. **Search**:
   - Search events by name, date, or category.
   - Advanced search with multiple filters.
5. **Notifications** (optional for advanced functionality):
   - Notify users of upcoming events they've RSVPed to.
   - Notify event organizers when a user RSVPs.

### **2. Features & Functionality**:

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Use Django's built-in authentication.
   - Role-based access (admin, event organizer, attendee).
2. **Event Management**:
   - CRUD operations for events.
   - Calendar integration to view events in a calendar format.
   - Waitlist functionality for full events.
   - Generate and show QR codes for event check-in.
3. **Reviews**:
   - CRUD operations for reviews.
   - Aggregate event ratings from reviews.
4. **Search & Filters**:
   - Keyword search.
   - Filter by date, location, category.
5. **User Dashboards**:
   - Event organizers can see their events, attendees, and reviews.
   - Attendees can see their RSVPs, past attended events, and upcoming events.
6. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to ensure the site is mobile-responsive.
7. **API Integration** (to expand your skills):
   - Integrate with map services like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap for event locations.
   - Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to create APIs for events, which can be consumed by other applications or for a mobile app in the future.
8. **Notifications**:
   - Email notifications.
   - In-app notifications using Django messages.

### **3. Database Models**:

1. **Users**:
   - Custom user model extending the built-in user model.
   - Additional fields: profile picture, bio, etc.
2. **Events**:
   - Fields: name, description, location, start_time, end_time, organizer (ForeignKey to user), image, attendees (ManyToMany to users), etc.
3. **Reviews**:
   - Fields: event (ForeignKey to events), user (ForeignKey to user), rating, comment.
4. **Categories**:
   - Fields: name.
   - ManyToMany relationship with events.

### **4. Future Enhancements**:

1. **Payments**: If events require a fee, integrate with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
2. **Social Media Integration**: Share events on platforms like Facebook, Twitter.
3. **Live Chat/Comments**: For attendees and organizers to communicate in real-time.
